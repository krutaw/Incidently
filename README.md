# Incidently

> Incidently, pronounced [in-si-dent-lee], is named as an intentional mis-spelling of the word "incidentally" since the long-term goal for the toolset is indeed anything but incidental.  The intent is to ease the effort of communication and tracking of Incidents during the process while also tracking the details in a more standard way.
